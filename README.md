This code is going to be a very basic website.
The objective is to familiarize myself with git. Practice commiting 
changes and continue working with HTML.

Day 1: learning HTML
I had no previous knowledge of HTML before today. I am going to attempt 
to gain more knowledge with various forms of programming. Web development 
practice seems a good start for me to develop a good portfolio and
personal projects.
